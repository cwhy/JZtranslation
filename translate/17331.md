## Introduction:

Over the years, people haved been dreaming of creating machines with "Intellegence". From the symbolical "Deep Blue" and connectionist's NETtalk, to the statical based NLP system like "Watson" and Google search engine, computers can solve problems that are more and more complex.
Although the ideal goal of "Intelligence Life" have not taken shape, we are still excited to see the progress of the attempt that does not strictly follow the law of biology and W. V. Quine's self-referencing theorem. As a result, the computers can understand one's demand in an amzing way.

Imagining the following situations:
* The moment when you open the door, the computer will know that you are home and open the lights, and the computer will "follow your demand" by turning off the light when you say "Lights off"
* Computers will play the music when you are humming a part of the melody of it; all the home appliances can be remotely controled through the Internet.

* Get a grenade from behind and throwing out in full strengh, yelling "Fire in the hole"; holding an AK47 and pulling the trigger in the air by hand.

This is not purely imaginary, the air trigger-pulling is one of the Human-computer Interaction interfaces implemented in FreeLancer by Huang Zeyea et. al from Beihang University. The DIY smart home appliances are made by citizen scientist Yuan Xingyuan. People who work in science will make life better by their contribution, but the peoplt who really change the world are the ones who are crazy enough to believe that they can change the worlds.
We can get advanced features extracted without completely knowing the serects of the human brain. Brilliant functions can be achieved not only by SVM and differential geometry, but also by the interesting "shallow" AIs.

In this event the creater of FreeLancer will demostrate the body-interaction system and smart home appliance control system. He will try to introduce us the working principles of motion sensors, computer vision and voice recognition, and more cutting-edge technologies. There will be games and interactive sessions for experiencing "Air gesture control", limb control and voice control.
