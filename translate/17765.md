## Introduction:
Why the human brain can handle the tasks that seems impossible for the computers to solve? How does it percept a and learn from the patterns and the ubiquitus pricinples of the outside world? What is the direction and the driving force of the evolution of neural networks? Does the minified brain models equals to some kind of statistical physics process?

The host will bring thoughts and insights to the questions above using the example of the brain vision system, and give analysis of several classical examples in computational neuralscience and machine learning for a different perspective.

1. Statistical properties of natural images and the computation model of the rectina.
2. The hierarchical structure of the cortex in compared with Hierarchical Temporal Memory algorithm.
3. Boltzmann machine and the statistical themodynamics model of the brain.
