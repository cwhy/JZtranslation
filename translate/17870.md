## Introduction:
The topic of this week is random forest. This host is Dreamtree(王璠)

Dreamtree(王璠) is a Masters student in Chinese academy of science, he has both research and application experience on random forest.
He will introduce the basics of random forest, as well as the relatied theories and applications in the following areas:
* Human pose recognition (Kinect)
* Image segmentation
* Key point matching
* Object Tracking

Because of the outstanding performance on big data(Easy to parallelize, fast training and testing, good generaizability), random forest has become one of the most favorble machine learning algorithms. It gets more and more adoption in the field of computer vision, bioinfomatics and data mining.

The most impactful application is the human pose recognition in Kinect, which contributed one third of the profit of the gaming department of Microsoft.
